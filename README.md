# codonnier_login

This pub package is a login screen for Flutter applications. It is designed to be used with the 
codonnier_network package. For checking the user's credentials, the package uses the codonnier_network
package to send a POST request to the server. The server should respond with a JSON object containing
the user's information. The package then saves the user's information to the device's storage.
